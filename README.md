## MERN Social Media App

A social media app made with ReactJs, Express, MongoDB and Node.

There are 2 types of users:

Other technologies/libraries used:

- Axios for communication between frontend and backend

### What I learned?

This project is a better application than the final project resulted as a summary of the knowlegde I learned through the MERN Fullstack Web Application with React & Web Development Course on Udemy.

In this project I learned how to work with MongoDB and mongoose and also tried using the design library Ant Design. I also used the useForm hook from antd for the form data.

More practice with React, Redux and Express.

### How to run ?

Backend(client)

> npm run

Frontend(client)

> npx serve -s build
